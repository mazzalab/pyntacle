        Compute the *Google PageRank* algorithm of a node or of a list of nodes of an undirected graph.
        The PageRank algorithm is a modified version of the eigenvector centrality. The importance of a node is here a
        function of the number of issuing edges and the importance of the neighbour nodes. A likelihood distribution
        is computed to check what is the chance that a random walk passes through the selected node(s). The higher is
        the centrality of the node, the higher is the probability of passing through it.
