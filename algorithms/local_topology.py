        r"""
        Compute the *radiality-reach* of a node or of a list of nodes of an undirected graph.
        The radiality-reach is a weighted version of the canonical radiality measure and it is recommended for
        graphs with multiple components. Specifically, if a graph has more than one components, we calculate the
        radiality for each node inside the component, then we multiply the radiality value by the proportion of nodes
        of that component over all nodes in the graph.
        Hence, the radiality-reach of a graph with only one component will be equal to the radiality, while nodes in
        a graph with two disconnected components will exhibit radiality values for each components and weighted over the
        contribution of that component to the whole graph.

        .. note:: the radiality reach of node isolates is zero by definition

        :param None,str,list nodes: The input nodes on which to compute the centrality index. When :py:class:`None`, it computes the radiality reach for all nodes in the graph. Otherwise, a single node  (identified using the ``name`` attribute) or a list of node names can be passed to compute radiality reach only for the subset of node of interest
