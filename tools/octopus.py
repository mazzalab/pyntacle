        Computes the *m-reach* metric for a given *key player* set (kp-set). Nodes are identified by the vertex ``name`` attribute and must belong to the input graph and computes the resulting dR value of these nodes in the graph by means of the :func:`~algorithms.keyplayer.KeyPlayer.dR` Pyntacle  method.

        The fragmentation status after node removal is then wrapped in the ``mreach_kpinfo`` graph attribute, a dictionary whose keys are tuple storing the vertex ``name``(s) and the corresponding value is the mreach for the input nodes

        This method encompasses the same procedure performed by the ``pyntacle key-player kp-info`` command on Pyntacle command line.
