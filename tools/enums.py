    An enumerator that is used to use different heuristics for the computation of the shortest paths among all nodes in the graph
    In detail, the avilable enumerators are:
        * ``igraph``: uses the :meth:`shortest_paths<igraph:igraph.Graph.shortest_paths>` embedded in :class:`~pyntacle.shortest_path.ShortestPath`
        * ``cpu``: uses the `Floyd-Warshall algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm>`_  by means of parallel CPU computing to obtain a matrix of distances for all nodes in the graph.This method returns a matrix (:py:class:`numpy.ndarray`) of shortest paths. Infinite distances actually equal the total number of vertices plus one.
        * ``gpu``: same as ``cpu``, but using parallel GPU processing (enabled when a CUDA-supported device is present). This method returns a matrix (:py:class:`numpy.ndarray`) of shortest paths. Infinite distances actually equal the total number of vertices plus one.

        .. warning:: Use this implementation **only** if the `CUDA Toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_ is installed on your machine and your CUDA device has CUDA 2.0 onwards
