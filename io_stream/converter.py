        Converts an edge list file into a Simple Interaction File (*SIF*) format.
        If the edge list file contains an header (a first line stating the nature of the nodes),
        this will be written into the SIF file. The *interaction type*, a field required to generate a SIF, is set to
        ``interacts_with`` for each pair of interacting nodes.

        We refer to the `Pyntacle File Formats Guide <http://pyntacle.css-mendel.it/resources/file_formats/file_formats.html>`_
        for more information on how these network files are structured.
